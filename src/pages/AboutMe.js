          ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m Yash Pande â€” a curious and passionate software developer with a deep-rooted love for building impactful tech. Currently working at HSBC, I bring experience across cloud technologies, full-stack development, and DevOps.

          I graduated from Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) with a degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, but my heart has always belonged to software. From building scalable web platforms to deploying cloud-native microservices, I thrive at the intersection of problem-solving and creativity.

          My journey so far includes internships at places like Oro Labs, Fetch.ai and ZentrumHub, where Iâ€™ve worked on everything from localization and UI bugs to decentralized systems and API documentation. Iâ€™ve also built real-world applicationsâ€”from a courier marketplace using AI agents to a hackathon project platform for students.

          Outside the code editor, you'll find me leading teams, mentoring juniors, or battling it out on a chessboard or cricket field. I believe in learning by doing, leading by example, and always staying curious.
