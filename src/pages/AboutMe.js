          👋 Hey there! I’m Harshwardhan Atkare — a curious and passionate software developer with a deep-rooted love for building impactful tech. Currently working as a Technology Consultant at Morgan Stanley (via Wissen Technology), I bring experience across full-stack development, cloud technologies and DevOps.

          I graduated from Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) with a degree in Computer Engineering. From building scalable web platforms to deploying cloud-native microservices, I thrive at the intersection of problem-solving and creativity.
          </p>

          My journey so far includes internships at places like Mibaio, Rebert , where I’ve worked on everything from localization and UI bugs to decentralized systems and API documentation. I’ve also built real-world applications—from a courier marketplace using AI agents to a hackathon project platform for students.

          Outside the code editor, you'll find me leading teams, mentoring juniors, or battling it out on a basketball field. I believe in learning by doing, leading by example, and always staying curious.
